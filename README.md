# covid

I'm too tired to even figure out how people gotthe latest vue set up  template to get uploadeed to github, I think I have the steps written at home in my notebook, so this will have to be my failure of a checkpoint.


Covid ruined everything for me, I'm crushed by this, I wanted to just struggle into passing like everyone else, but I think I've taken such a long break from coding that I don't remember where to start.
